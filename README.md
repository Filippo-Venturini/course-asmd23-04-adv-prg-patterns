## Task 1 - Test-Operate

In the first phase a Scala object is created at the following path: *"test.scala.u04.datastructures.Task1SequenceCheck.scala"*.
Here there is a proprety for test with `ScalaCheck` that the "of" operator is a correct factory. Before the proprety some parameters of `ScalaCheck` like `minSuccesfulTests` are tested.
